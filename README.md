## Note:
1. Insert the 3-digit airport IATA code that you want to get the value of in between quotation marks.

For example: print(Korean_Civil_Airports_IATA_Code_Converter["GMP"]). Here you insert GMP as the code.
2. Run it.
3. Value will be returned as long as the program recognizes the key, otherwise there would be error remarks.
4. Insert 3-digit airport IATA code one at a time, otherwise there would be error remarks.
